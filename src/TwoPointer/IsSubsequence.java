    /**
     * Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
     *
     * A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
     *
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
     * Output: true
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
     * Output: false
     *
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * 0 <= s.length <= 100
     * 0 <= t.length <= 104
     * s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
